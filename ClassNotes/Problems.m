% Problem
% Given function x^2-1
% Represent it in a plynomail vector format
% plot it bewteen x=0 x=2
% find it's root by hand and with MATLAB
% factor it bby hand and with MATLaB
% preform differntiation and indefinite integration by and 
% evaluate the numerical derivative at x=1
% perform nuerical integration between x=0 and x=2 using two methods in matlab 
% compare it to the analytical solution
% 
% 
% Solve the folllowing system of equations using MATLAB
% 3y--x+z=0
% 2x-5y+1=z
% x+y-z=1
